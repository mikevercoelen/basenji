## The problem

Setting up a solid boilerplate for your React / Redux application sucks.

Basenji solves this problem.

## Motivation

The last 6 months I have deeply researched [most boilerplates, starter kits and webpack configurations](https://github.com/xgrommx/awesome-redux). Basenji is the result of this research.

## Why use Basenji?

* You have NO boilerplate stuff anymore, no webpack stuff, no nothing, just your application code.
* Basenji uses optimization techniques to create the best possible webpack configuration with fast builds and rebuilds.

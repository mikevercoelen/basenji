# Motivation

As the requirements for JavaScript single-page applications have become increasingly complicated, **our code must manage more state than ever before**. This state can include server responses and cached data, as well as locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we need to manage the active route, the selected tab, whether to show a spinner or not, should pagination controls be displayed, and so on.
